      <h3>KITTIES PROFILES</h3>
      <p>Each kitty has a profile that provides their history and favorite activities.
      Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then <em>retire to the warmest spot</em> on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.</p>

      <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>

      <p>Precious is the sweetest kitten and loves to cuddle. Precious showed up one day very sick. She was only a couple months old and really in bad shape. With the help of a caring vetenarian and lots of TLC she grew to be a healthy and strong kitten. While we tried to find her owner she ended up becoming a most <em>precious</em> part of our family. As she has aged she has slowed down some, but has become an avid cuddler...<em>purr purr purr.</em></p>
